== Installation ==

These installation instructions assume you have an active account established on Woopra.com.  If not, please visit the site and sign up for service.

Using the manual method:

1. Extract the Woopra.zip file to a location on your local machine
2. Upload the `woopra` folder and all contents into the `/plugins/` directory

Using the automatic method:

1. Click on 'Download' or 'Upgrade'
2. Wait for WordPress to acknowledge that it is on your system and ready to activate.

After step 2 (of either method):

3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Make sure the status is On in the Woopra settings page.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for the WordPress Plugin to work, your WordPress theme must have the following code immediately before the </HEAD> element in the header.php file:

    `<?php wp_head(); ?>`

Without this function, the Woopra application will fail to track users who visit your site.
